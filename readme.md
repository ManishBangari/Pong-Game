# Pong Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Java. It allows two players to control paddles and compete against each other.

## How to Run the Game

### Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher

### Running the Game

1. Download the "Pong.java" file and save it to a directory on your computer.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the "Pong.java" file is located.

3. Compile the Java code using the `javac` command:

   ```bash
   javac Pong.java
   ```

   This will generate the "Pong.class" file, which contains the compiled bytecode.

4. Run the game using the `java` command:

   ```bash
   java Pong
   ```

   This will start the Pong game, and a window will appear where you can play the game.

## Controls

- Player 1 (left side): Use the 'W' key to move the paddle up and the 'S' key to move the paddle down.
- Player 2 (right side): Use the 'Up' arrow key to move the paddle up and the 'Down' arrow key to move the paddle down.

## Exiting the Game

To exit the game, simply close the game window by clicking the close button (X) on the window's title bar.
